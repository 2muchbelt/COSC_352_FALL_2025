# Project2 Docker Usage

This project packages `project2.py` into a Docker container so you can run it easily without worrying about installing Python or dependencies.

## Build the Docker Image

From the project root (where the Dockerfile is located), run:

```bash
docker build -t project2 .
```

This command creates a Docker image named **project2**.

## Run the Script with a URL

To run the script and print results to the screen, pass the target URL as an argument when starting the container:

```bash
docker run --rm project2 <URL>
```

### Example

```bash
docker run --rm project2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages
```

This will execute:

```
python project2.py https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages
```

inside the container, and youâ€™ll see the scriptâ€™s output directly in your terminal.

## Notes

- `--rm` automatically removes the container after it finishes running (to keep things clean).
- If you want to debug or run interactively, you can start a shell inside the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm project2 /bin/bash
```

Then you can run `python project2.py <URL>` manually inside.
